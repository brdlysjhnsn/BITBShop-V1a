        <p>You can trust me with your baking needs!</p>

        <p>I have always felt at home in a bakery, any bakery. I know today is going to be okay when I drive into the bakery parking lot. I know I am where I belong. Beyond doubt it is dark and early. My sleep pattern is atrocious (I’ve slept on bags of flour more than once), anything but ordinary.</p>

        <p>My memories of bakeries go back into my youth and younger and younger days. I can tell you of days going to the Federal Bakeshop in St. Joseph, Missouri. The incredible smell of fresh pastries, breads, cookies, pies, and the beautiful cakes. “I want” is the only way to express the desire to get everything. Danish has been my personal favorite of all time. Give me a hot Danish (any flavor) right out of the oven, and I will give you anything.</p>

        <p>The summer after I finished kindergarten, we moved across the big Missouri River to Atchison, Kansas. Dad had bought his first bakery. Now the bakery became my second home. On weekends, I’d jump at the chance to get up at 12:30 a.m. to go to work with Dad. I wasn’t much help those days; I did a lot of watching, amazed by the huge bags of flour that I couldn’t even budge. By 5 a.m., I’d be asleep upon one of these 100‑pound bags.</p>

        <p>Later in the morning I’d be nudged, and Dad would tell me it was time to get busy. I was big enough to help clean, to grab a broom and start sweeping. I must be the worst sweeper of all time; it seems I’ve never graduated from sweeping. My duties grew with my ability to stay awake in the early mornings. I would stand on a milk crate and learn how to handle the donut sticks and flip the donuts in the fryer, even before I was strong enough or had the reach to dip the screens of proofed donuts into the grease or take them out, or lift the glazer hopper to glaze them. But Lord, I got to eat warm donuts freshly made before they ever got cold. There is something to the saying “get ’em while they are hot.”</p>

        <p>One week it was my turn to deliver the treats for my Cub Scout meeting. I took chocolate éclairs that I had helped to finish—filled with Parisian cream and iced on top. I was a great scout!</p>

        <p>When I graduated high school, I joined the Navy like my father had done. I have always wanted to be like Dad. After the Navy, my dad had a donut shop where I was his partner. I can remember all too well mixing the dough by hand with a canoe paddle. We covered a bakery rack with a tarp and put an electric skillet on the bottom to make steam for a simulated proof box. Then, after a while, we closed the donut shop and both of us went to work for a central bakery in Channelview that distributed baked goods to a half dozen grocery stores.</p>

        <p>Here at this large bakery there were two huge revolving ovens that could hold 75 full sheet pans at a time. I also experienced a pizza oven where it was necessary to turn the pans from inside end to outside end to get an even bake. This took away labor from doing other things since it needed rotated every few minutes or the end in back of the oven would burn rapidly.</p>

        <p>There was a walk‑through proof box where you put a rack in, then another rack, and then another rack till the first rack came out the other end ready for the oven. Here is where I began mixing on the big Hobart mixers. Breads were divided up (scaled) by hand, kneaded and balled up by hand, and then pounded flat and rolled into loaves by hand. A German baker taught me how to braid challah bread.</p>

        <p>I learned how to run my first dough sheeter to turn large loaves of dough into long thin sheets to cut donuts. We’d pick the donuts up six at a time with both hands and lay the dozen donuts in lines on the frying screens (whereas in our donut shop we had a single biscuit cutter to cut the donuts one at a time). There was also a Duchess dough divider that you put a three‑ or five‑pound piece of dough into and out came 36 pieces the same size.</p>

        <p>A cookie machine called the Cookie King cranked out cookies as fast as you could crank the handle. We would get 35‑pound cans of frozen fruit and add sugar and starch and cinnamon to make pie filling. A pie press was available for making pie crusts in the aluminum pie pans.</p>

        <p>Here we used ingredients from JW Allen, which probably is on the higher end of price to make the best products you can find, as opposed to Rustco products which would be on the cheaper end. The Rustco items seemed to always be doctored up to get into a presentable product. In between, I’ve used Best Brands, American Products, Pillsbury, Dawn, Durkee, and Rich’s, all being superior to Rustco and falling shy of the JW Allen supplies.</p>

        <p>I managed to get married along about this time and never worked with my father again. One of the first jobs I had as a family man was for Jamail’s of Kingwood. I began as a donut fryer and was a baker in a heartbeat and bakery manager as soon as you could turn around. I began making items you could not find anywhere else, like chocolate mint cake and pineapple coconut orange Bundt rings. For the first time, the Kingwood bakery outperformed the other Jamail’s locations in contribution to store profits with better labor control and less shrink.</p>

        <p>After this I found myself in Lubbock working for Furr’s Inc. at their Food Emporium stores. Along with the full‑line bakery there was a tortilla shop for fresh tortillas. It was in these Food Emporium bakeries I worked hand in hand with several Mexican bakers who showed me some Mexican baking. We mixed cookies by hand on tabletops without any bowls or utensils, just our hands. We made pan de huevo, semitas de anís, bolillos, empanadas, and wedding cookies. I was introduced to the double‑wing sheeter and an automatic bread machine. For the first time, I made cheesecake from scratch as well as hand‑rolled croissants we sold each afternoon for a quarter apiece, hot out of the oven.</p>

        <p>We also provided breads and sweets for The Bistro restaurant and a satellite location of The Bistro. This was a 5,000‑square‑foot bakery with its own receiving dock and massive walk‑in coolers and freezers. This was also the first bakery where we recycled day‑old sweets into banana nut bread and blonde brownies.</p>

        <p>I went on to Albertsons and once again worked through donut fryer (here there was a dual set of fryers that took considerable timing to run both at the same time) where we kicked out hundreds of dozens of donuts every day. We used an electric Cookie King machine which took two people to operate—one would feed pans into the machine while the second would catch them coming out.</p>

        <p>It was here in Amarillo that upon arrival to work we would check which direction the wind was blowing. If wind came from the west at good speed it would help the oven to bake faster, and if the wind came hard enough from the east it would slow down the rate of speed the oven functioned at.</p>

        <p>With Albertsons I transferred numerous times till I ended up in Conroe as Albertsons broke the Houston market. In Houston I traveled around (on top of managing my bakery) to over 20 new store openings and helped train the new store bakery staff. Working for Albertsons, I received the Triple Crown Award for making my goals more than once and bonused three out of four quarters each year for outdoing projections.</p>

        <p>Once a month, we had French Bread Saturday, when our goal was to sell 1,000 loaves of French bread in one day. It was challenging enough to get 1,000 loaves baked in one day on top of normal production—and then to get the bread sold the same day. Each year we had a French bread contest to see who could sell the most in the month. My best effort churned out 11,000 loaves, a record still standing today.</p>

        <p>It was standard business at Albertsons to have Boy Scouts come into the store and demo chocolate chip cookies and sell bags of cookies where at the end of the day they would take a quarter home for each bag sold. I was the only one ever to utilize the local high school’s French club to come into the store for the month to demo the French bread and talk French to the customers to achieve success. Then the French club got money to put towards their summer trip to France.</p>

    <section id="living-with-mom">
        <h2>Living With Mom and Starting Over</h2>

        <p>I had been living with Mom, not by choice, as my choice had been decided by the parole council. After tomorrow, I can find any place anywhere. My sentence is finished, completed. On with my life!</p>

        <p>I have recovered from the blow landed upon me 13 years ago with my wife’s sudden, tragic death. Mom, bless her heart, passed in August of 2024. Oh, how she knew what trips my trigger. I bathe regularly, I stay on top of my laundry. I know she doesn’t smell me through my door or through the air conditioning vents. She is delusional, I thought.</p>

        <p>Turns out this smell was the breaker box overloading the main bar, which was jerry‑rigged. A new breaker box up to code and five grand later, the smell she kept smelling was gone—the stuff that’s not there. Of course, at 86 she’s allowed, and she was right; she just couldn’t figure that one out. But still.</p>

        <p>The last time I lived with my parents was immediately after my dismissal from the Navy. It was a short stay of maybe eight months. I met my wife at this time and was married before you know it. As a young family starting out, we moved into Mel’s parents’ old house directly behind their new house. As soon as I was unpacked, I remember my father‑in‑law became unemployed, and just like that it was as if I was supporting two households instead of one. When he finally went back to work, we moved away so that situation could not present itself again.</p>

        <p>This was when I had my first baking job without my dad (who was a baker/manager also). I had worked with Dad a couple of times before this.</p>

    <section id="jobs-and-sunrise">
        <h2>All the Jobs and the Sunrise Ritual</h2>

        <p>So, I’ve been a newspaper boy, a dishwasher at my father’s bakery, a busboy at a pizza parlor, a bagboy at a grocery store (more than once), a fast‑food cook, a stocker, an electrician’s helper, and an appliance salesman before, in between, and after my baking jobs.</p>

        <p>While working my sixth baking job in Grand Prairie (and living in Arlington), I planned my first break at work each day to coincide with daybreak, as I have done most of my years in bakeries. The sunrise seems to keep me grounded.</p>

        <p>My friend and co‑worker John was sitting beside me one morning, and unexpectedly he blurts out, “I would have made a great SEAL team member.” John knows I’ve had every chance and reason to abandon this crappy job, yet I continue to excel in this hopeless hole. It’s a shame; all I’ve ever had was a crappy hole to hide in.</p>

        <p>I do believe John is right, right down the line. I take care of John better than anyone takes care of me. I don’t mind. In fact, I rarely even think of these things. By now, the new day’s light has arrived, bringing wonderful color to everything—God’s finest work. May God’s light shine through us.</p>

        <p>The drudgery—ugh—back to menial tasks, performed every single day. Just to do my part, breaking my back to make others appear to be the best. If I have your back, then there is no doubt: nothing will creep up on you. John Howard III, Navy Frogman, among the very first SEAL team trainers, thinks highly of me, as I do of him.</p>

        <p>It takes more than a single reason for anyone to act. Always, there are ulterior motives which may never be known. But when there are enough reasons to act, then act one will.</p>

        <p>So, I plan my sunrise breaks to see the most beautiful women start their days. Trading smiles is the warmest feeling I know outside of family. To give every person I see a smile is part of my ritual morning prayer. I also give thanks for all I have, all I have coming to me, and all I have had the honor to have had in the past. I ask God to let me walk with Him, to give my body to Him for His purpose. And most important to me, I beg God to send my guardian angel to another person who’s in greater need than I am. This always helps me to remember there are others in worse shape than yours truly.</p>

        <p>Ah, just another day in the life of a baker. A baker’s son I never wanted to be anything other than—to be like my father. God rest his soul. The older I get, the more like Dad I’ve become. I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

    <section id="crockett-and-future">
        <h2>Lost in Crockett and Still Moving</h2>

        <p>I’ve lived here in Crockett, Texas just over a year now. Out on parole, with 17 months to go before my sentence has been completed. Not driving (a condition of my parole) before July of next year, I’ve been on foot (and bicycle) looking for a job close enough for me to be able to make it to. I’ve applied and reapplied so many times. I’ve had several nibbles, but no luck. Except one fast‑food restaurant where I could not manage to stand in the same place long enough without my damaged nerves in my left leg going haywire. Then an unbearable pain would accompany this leg where I would have to sit down. I ended up resigning this position with a mutual understanding.</p>

        <p>As soon as I get my truck back on the road my opportunities will blossom. I have come upon dark days of this life, testing my faith daily. I am somehow bent on making a superior “Moore’s law” than ever before. I pray there are no more attempts after this one becomes bearable again.</p>

        <p>I did not choose a profession; it seems all my jobs I’ve fallen into one way or another. By accident it seems. While selling home appliances might be a piece of cake, I am much more at home in a bakery. I am a lifelong student, always learning. Perhaps in a classroom, perhaps on the streets, or upon the wide‑open seas. I have learned everywhere I’ve been—from the Mississippi River to the east and all the way to Africa to the west.</p>

        <p>I can be as good as anyone at anything it seems. At the same time, I was raised to know in my heart that I am no better than anyone. Walking this line has put a damper on things to say the least. I am a good hand. I am willing, able, and loyal, till greed enters the scene. I hate narcissism, and I prefer not to be the center of attention. I simply have not found a challenging goal to fulfill me. Well, other than my wife (together the two of us were one).</p>

        <p>Now, I’m an obese, old ex‑felon, with no future. I could not handle my spouse’s death and lost everything. I’ve gone from collecting guns to having guitars surrounding me. Funny thing is I never shot the guns and I don’t play guitar. I have only dreamed of having a keen eye, yet one day still, I may surprise myself and learn to play guitar. Still, I love both.</p>

        <p>Some days I can barely get out of bed. Barely breathe. So, what happens when you’re no longer useful, when there’s nothing left to give, when you’re no more than a big waste? Thank God for family. Without my sister I’d be in the streets, homeless (same for Mom). This I know and yet, I cannot get a plan together to survive on my own without a job, or transportation of my own. At least, not in Crockett, Texas. Here I am lost. Lost in Crockett. Not here, not now, my time has passed.</p>

        <p>Still, I’ve gone back to school to finish a bachelor’s degree in CIS, networking. How does this make any sense? I’ll be 60 years old, without experience, without any “in’s,” and wondering if I’ll be wandering still after this.</p>

        <p>I received eyeglasses in the first grade and have been blind even before then. I did not see the crime I committed; I blacked out, and in twenty seconds ruined my life. Time will tell all of this.</p>

        <p>I have been blessed to have four sisters and four daughters. It’s a good thing I like girls, really like girls, or I could have bolted at the age of, say, six. I love my girls and hope they all know how much I miss them. The grandkids (amazing that four are boys) are missed tenfold.</p>

    <section id="health-and-weight">
        <h2>Body, Weight, and the Fight to Change</h2>

        <p>My legs and weight (diabetes) are my biggest obstacles in living a meaningful life right now. Nerve damage in my left leg keeps me from standing in a spot for any length of time, and sitting extended periods causes leg cramps (as well as legs going to sleep). I watch my sugar intake (sometimes not so good; I have been a baker most of my life) and try not to overeat but lack the willpower to move more. I need to exercise and work out. I just plain need to do this regularly, not occasionally.</p>

        <p>A bit of counseling may be what I need. As soon as I’m asked if I want to kill myself, I’m done with them. I only think of this choice while sitting in front of a counselor who brings the thought up. Not ever, even once on my own, do any thoughts of hurting anybody exist. This is a troublesome situation as to having a wreck with someone I never saw getting seriously hurt.</p>

        <p>I lost everything that day I had my wreck. In 15 seconds my life changed forever. Rock bottom I hit is what they say (couldn’t go any lower). I’ve seen a lot of fools in the penitentiary. I didn’t like any of them. Some couldn’t help it; they were seriously crazy (it was “5150” tattooed on them someplace, certifiable and they were proud of it, very proud indeed). It was like looking in the mirror every time I turned around.</p>

        <p>I have not ever been able to understand how someone would intentionally hurt another, and killing is another thing, yet every day I saw them, and they saw me (neither being a threat to either). I understand how a man might walk in on his wife and another man, then in the heat of the moment kill him or her, or both
