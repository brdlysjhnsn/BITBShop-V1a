        <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
        <p>
            BITBShop wasn’t born in a boardroom. It was born in flour dust, early‑morning darkness,
            and the steady rhythm of a father and son working side by side. Our story stretches across
            four bakeries, three states, and a lifetime of lessons — the kind you can only learn with
            your hands in the dough.

        <h2>Vick’s Pastry Shop — Atchison, Kansas</h2>
        <p>
            The first bakery sat twenty‑three miles across the Missouri River in Atchison, Kansas.
            To a six‑year‑old boy, Vick’s Pastry Shop felt enormous — giant sinks, towering flour bags,
            mixers hanging overhead like steel monsters. It was a world of heat, sugar, and discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned early that bakeries are built on repetition, craft, and heart. I tasted cake batters,
            pie fillings, and the magic of watching raw ingredients become something people loved.
            Vick’s was condemned two years later, but it never left me. It became the foundation of
            everything that came after.

        <h2>Johnson Mall Pastry Shop — Growing Into the Craft</h2>
        <p>
            Dad’s second bakery was bigger, brighter, and busier. This is where I stopped being a kid
            in a bakery and started becoming a baker. I learned to knead dough, round loaves, flip donuts
            like drumsticks, and run batches big enough to feed a town.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was also where life got real — accidents, crushes, long mornings, and the slow unraveling
            of the business as inflation crushed small shops across America. Dad went bankrupt in 1975.
            We lost the house, but not the work ethic.

        <h2>The Cleveland Donut Shop — A Second Chance</h2>
        <p>
            Years later, after the Navy and some rough patches, Dad rescued me again. We opened a tiny
            donut shop in Cleveland, Texas — mixing dough with a canoe paddle and proofing under a tarp
            with electric frying pans for humidity. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was ours.
        </p>
        <p>
            Customers came back because the donuts were good — scratch‑made, honest, and consistent.
            When Dad lost his job at Brookshire Brothers, the donut shop ended too. But that little place
            gave me something priceless: a second chance, and time with my dad as a partner, not just a son.

        <h2>The Last Little Bakery — St. Joseph, Missouri</h2>
        <p>
            After a triple bypass surgery, Mom and Dad retired to St. Joe, where Dad opened one final bakery —
            a tiny, patched‑together shop with almost no equipment and even less curb appeal. But with his touch,
            it became something warm and charming.
        </p>
        <p>
            I brought my four kids to see it once. Shortly after the grand opening, Dad sold the bakery to a young
            baker and moved back to Texas. A quiet, fitting end to a lifetime spent in flour and heat.

        <h2>Why BITBShop Exists</h2>
        <p>
            BITBShop stands on the shoulders of those four bakeries — on the lessons learned in the dark before
            sunrise, on the smell of fresh dough, on the belief that small places can do big things with enough heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m not just building a business. I’m carrying forward a legacy — my dad’s, my family’s, and the craft
            that shaped my life. This is our story. And now, it becomes part of yours.
