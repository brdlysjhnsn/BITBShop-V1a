    <h2>My Friends' Escapades</h2>

    <p>
        My earliest friend I remember is Larry Kuhn. We watched a lot of
        <em>Gilligan’s Island</em> and <em>Speed Racer</em> after school. We would walk to the
        Skate Park and hunt for crawdads. Back then there were tennis courts instead of the
        skate park and an opening to the under‑street sewer system. There, for one thing, lived
        bats (there were even more bats out at the old rock quarry along the river), and the
        rumor of alligators was a second thing that kept me out of the underground tunnels.
        I had nightmares of these tunnels growing up.
    </p>

        Some days after school, we would play baseball and then go to Tim Jackson’s house and
        hang out on their front porch watching the cars go down Kansas Ave. He lived two blocks
        on the other side of Central Elementary, so those days I liked having my bicycle—a green
        spider‑like bike with 20” wheels, a banana seat, and high handlebars. It had three speeds
        and front and rear hand brakes.

        Tim Trower would stay after school for ball and wait to be picked up at Tim Jackson’s by
        his parents most days. In 2nd grade, one day Tim Trower had to exit class unexpectedly.
        You could only see the back of his head as he went, escorted by Ms. Ford. Being a grade
        school, it wasn’t far to take him to the nurse’s office and return. We didn’t have enough
        time to miss Ms. Ford before she was lecturing and preaching the vices of inserting foreign
        items into your body—whether it was your ears, mouth, nose (Tim Trower’s experience was
        with a pencil eraser), or hidden places. Don’t stick things where they don’t
<p>Seems a letter accompanied us home from school on the subject as well.
        The only player I remember from the Giants little league baseball team was Patches Logan.
        Patches was the one who almost always made the winning play for our team.
        I reconnected a moment with Patches only to learn he had never been more than an hour from Atchison.
        His whole life had never slept away from home.</p>

<p>My best friend from Atchison was Steve Ewbank.

    Steve was the older brother to Edie (a girl who would later have my dream job, working for SPRINT),
    and Paul. Steve <p>was from a very intellectual family.
        Steve would be playing one on one basketball with me.
        We would be having all this competition. Then Steve would say;
        Playing ball is done for now, have to go get a drink and watch Star Trek.
        Or we would be playing chess and it would be the same thing. Have to go watch Star Trek.
        Whatever—Steve was a Trekkie. I hated Star Trek, I’d rather still be playing games.</p>

<p>We would ride our bicycle all over Atchison, and on Saturday mornings,
    I’d ride my bicycle all the way across town carrying my bowling ball,
    so I could bowl in a youth league. Steve became a senior Engineer at Delphi
    supplying the car industry with electronics. I have lived to know I wouldn’t trade places
    with Steve these days, as Steve has a couple of handicapped kids who will forever be his dependents,
    totally sad.</p>

<p>Janet Barr was this cute redhead I had a crush on.
    At the same time, there was always Susan Wilson showing up at all the wrong moments.
    Judy Sellers was another girl of my desires.</p>

<p>My oldest sister, Leslie, would take us to the drive in.
    Leslie, Leslie’s friend Sheila, Sheila’s little sister Judy and me!
    I really liked sitting by Judy as all 4 of us sat in the front seat,
    so nothing would happen in the back seat. But this sure was cozy.</p>

<p>At the fragile age of 14, I had to pack up and leave town
    and all there was in Atchison behind. For two months we spent in Oklahoma City
    before ending up in College Station, Texas where I knew no one and I was nobody.
    Here I crawled even farther behind my wall that I was putting up.</p>
